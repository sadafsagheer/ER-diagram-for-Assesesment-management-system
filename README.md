# ER-diagram-for-Assesesment-management-system
A project is proposed to design an assessment management system to keep track of course assessment submission in a university. Each course has unique ID, name, instructor, at least fifteen students and at least one subject. Each subject has a number, name, description, and at least one course assessment to be done. The subject number is unique for each course. Each assessment has a number that is unique for the given subject and has due submission date and time. In addition, each assessment has at least one given type (e.g. H: Homework, P: Program, E: Essay). Each submitted assessment is given a unique ID, has a submission timestamp (date and time) and belongs to one student only. Once an assessment is submitted, the system sends a message to the student acknowledging the submission and indicating whether the submission is on time or late. For each student, it is important to track the number of submission. Each student is identified by a unique ID, has a name, university-email, and registered in at least one course.
